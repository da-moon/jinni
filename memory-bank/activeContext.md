*   [2025-04-02 18:36:19] - Refined design details in DESIGN.md (Tool name -> `read_context`, abort on size limit, skip symlinks, global CLI config). Updated PLAN.md and decisionLog.md accordingly.
*   [2025-04-02 18:45:37] - Further refined `read_context` tool design (single path, optional inline rules). Updated DESIGN.md, PLAN.md, README.md, and decisionLog.md.

## Open Questions/Issues
*   [2025-04-02 19:16:35] - Feature Request: Allow CLI to accept multiple directory/file paths as positional arguments, avoiding duplicate output.
*   [2025-04-02 19:16:35] - Feature Request: Add new MCP tool `read_context_list` to handle multiple paths and avoid duplicates, similar to the CLI request.
*   [2025-04-02 19:29:52] - Architectural Question: Should distribution/installation shift from Python/`pip` to Node.js/`npm`/`npx` as suggested by user? Requires discussion/decision.
