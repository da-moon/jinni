## Current Focus

*   [2025-04-04 13:04:30] - Current focus is implementing the finalized re-architecture plan: dynamic `PathSpec` compilation during traversal in `core_logic.py`, handling `.contextfiles` hierarchy, implementing overrides, ensuring explicit target inclusion, and updating CLI, server, docs, and tests accordingly.

## Recent Changes

*   [2025-04-02 18:07:54] - Initialized Memory Bank files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md).
*   [2025-04-02 18:13:48] - Updated productContext.md with initial project details based on codedump analysis (README.md, prototype.py).
*   [2025-04-02 18:29:10] - Finalized project plan (see PLAN.md) and updated Memory Bank (decisionLog, progress, activeContext).
*   [2025-04-02 18:36:19] - Refined design details in DESIGN.md (Tool name -> `read_context`, abort on size limit, skip symlinks, global CLI config). Updated PLAN.md and decisionLog.md accordingly.
*   [2025-04-02 18:45:37] - Further refined `read_context` tool design (single path, optional inline rules). Updated DESIGN.md, PLAN.md, README.md, and decisionLog.md.
*   [2025-04-02 18:46:44] - Completed Task 1 (Detailed Design & Documentation). Updated progress.md.
*   [2025-04-02 18:50:49] - Created initial unit test files (`tests/test_config_system.py`, `tests/test_core_logic.py`) with basic parsing, hierarchy, and formatting tests (Task 2).
*   [2025-04-02 18:53:33] - Created initial implementation files (`jinni/config_system.py`, `jinni/core_logic.py`) based on DESIGN.md (Task 3). Updated progress.md.
*   [2025-04-02 18:57:54] - Executed initial unit tests. Result: 2 Errors, 1 Failure. See terminal output for details.
*   [2025-04-02 19:07:54] - Debug mode successfully fixed failing unit tests in `core_logic.py` and `config_system.py`. All 10 tests now pass.
*   [2025-04-02 19:13:08] - Code mode created initial `jinni/server.py` implementing the MCP server based on DESIGN.md (Task 4).
*   [2025-04-02 19:14:20] - Code mode created initial `jinni/cli.py` implementing the command-line interface based on DESIGN.md (Task 5).
*   [2025-04-02 19:29:52] - Completed initial update of README.md (Task 6).
*   [2025-04-02 19:30:16] - Added Task 7: Implement Integration Tests (High Priority) based on user feedback.
*   [2025-04-03 16:27:00] - Approved plan to redesign `core_logic.py` directory traversal logic. Updated `decisionLog.md`.
*   [2025-04-03 17:22:00] - Approved major redesign of `.contextfiles` system (see `decisionLog.md`). Updated `DESIGN.md`, `README.md`, `productContext.md`, and `decisionLog.md`.
*   [2025-04-04 01:24:12] - Changed rule precedence logic based on user feedback: Inline rules now completely override local `.contextfiles`. Updated `config_system.py`, `DESIGN.md`, `README.md`, `decisionLog.md`.
*   [2025-04-04 12:33:00] - Approved major re-architecture of config system and core logic (see `decisionLog.md`). This involves factoring out rule building, using `pathlib`, unifying CLI/MCP override behavior, and updating related components (CLI, docs, tests).
*   [2025-04-04 13:04:30] - Finalized the re-architecture plan (see `decisionLog.md`) to use dynamic `PathSpec` compilation during traversal, incorporating feedback on `.contextfile` handling and explicit target inclusion.
## Open Questions/Issues
*   [2025-04-02 19:16:35] - Feature Request: Allow CLI to accept multiple directory/file paths as positional arguments, avoiding duplicate output.
*   [2025-04-02 19:16:35] - Feature Request: Add new MCP tool `read_context_list` to handle multiple paths and avoid duplicates, similar to the CLI request.
*   [2025-04-02 19:29:52] - Architectural Question: Should distribution/installation shift from Python/`pip` to Node.js/`npm`/`npx` as suggested by user? Requires discussion/decision.
*
*   [2025-04-03 14:00:02] - Feature Request: Add CLI option to automatically copy output to clipboard.
*   [2025-04-03 14:48:50] - Debugging `jinni_debug.log` inclusion issue paused. Requires `--debug-explain` output analysis.
